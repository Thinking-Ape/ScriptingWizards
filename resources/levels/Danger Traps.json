Boulders deactivate traps until removed!","You actually already know the important pieces of code to solve this problem! You may look up how to ask whether you're looking at a BOULDER or a KEY in your spellbook (hover your mouse over <ItemType> in the \"targetsItem()\" method).","An entity will drop whatever Item they are holding upon death. How can you trick the enemy into walking onto a trap and then take their key before it is destroyed by the trap?","Im sure there are many ways to solve this puzzle. I would suggest the following solution:","Write a while-loop that is active until the Knight is targeting a BOULDER. You can easily reuse your code from the last level. After you have arrived at the boulder, pick it up and start another while-loop where your Knight waits until he targets a KEY.","Now you only need to write a sequence of actions that will get you to the exit.\nIf you are having problems consider revisiting the last Level or checking the spellbook!"],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","spawn","path","trap","path","path","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["wall","path",{"flags":["armed"],"content":"trap"},"path",{"flags":["preparing"],"content":"trap"},"path","wall"],["wall","path","path","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall",{"item":"boulder","content":"trap"},"path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","path","exit","wall","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["wall","enemy_spawn","path","path","path",{"item":"key","content":"path"},"wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"]],"locToStars":[35,29]}
