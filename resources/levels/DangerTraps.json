Also note that traps will destroy any item or entity that is on top of them except for boulders! Boulders deactivate traps until removed!","You actually already know the important pieces of code to solve this problem! You may look up how to ask whether you're looking at a boulder or a key in your spellbook (hover your mouse over <ItemType> in the \"targetsItem()\" method).","An entity will drop whatever Item they are holding upon death. How can you trick the enemy into walking onto a trap and then take their key before it is destroyed by the trap?","Im sure there are many ways to solve this puzzle. I would suggest the following solution:","Write a while-loop with a boolean variable in its condition that brings you to the boulder. You can easily reuse your code from the last level. After you have arrived at the boulder, pick it up and start another while-loop that waits until a key appears before you. Then write a sequence of actions that will get you to the exit."],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","spawn","path","trap","path","path","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["wall","path",{"flags":["armed"],"content":"trap"},"path",{"flags":["preparing"],"content":"trap"},"path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall",{"item":"boulder","content":"trap"},"path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","path","exit","wall","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["wall","enemy_spawn","path","path","path",{"item":"key","content":"path"},"wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"]],"locToStars":[35,29]}
