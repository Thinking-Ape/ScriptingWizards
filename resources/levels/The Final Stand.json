The final test! And your final lesson!\nWith the data type Army you can now control multiple Knights at once!

If you need help check the spellbook first! If you can't solve it read further...","You will first need to make a Knight looking towards NORTH, then the other towards EAST. Then create an Army and let it move() until the first one is looking at a pressure plate. Let him take a step and wait while the other one keeps moving. Let both collect their items.","To do that I would suggest using two while-loops. End the first one as soon as the upper Knight targets a WALL and then let the lower Knight turn towards the DIRT and the upper one has to move into the beginning of the hall and needs to look towards the KEY.","Inside the first while-Loop you should write the part mentioned before, where both Knights move if there is nothing in front of them, the lower Knight should move twice if the upper is standing on a PRESSURE_PLATE and they collect whatever Item lies ahead.","In the second while loop, when both Knights are in the correct position, they should both alternate between moving and using their Items until the upper one targets a KEY..."],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","path","path","path","wall","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","wall","wall",{"id":3,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall",{"item":"sword","content":"path"},"wall","path","wall","path","path","path","wall","path","path","path","wall",{"id":1,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall",{"id":2,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall",{"id":0,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall","path","wall","wall","wall","path","path","path","wall","path","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","exit","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall","path","wall",{"item":"key","content":"path"},{"linkedIds":[1],"content":"path"},"path",{"linkedIds":[1],"content":"path"},"path",{"linkedIds":[1],"flags":["inverted"],"content":"gate"},"path","path","path","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","dirt","wall"],["wall","spawn","path","path","path",{"linkedIds":[0],"content":"gate"},"path","path","path",{"item":"shovel","content":"path"},"path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"]],"locToStars":[38,35]}
