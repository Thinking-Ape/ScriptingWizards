This makes things a lot more difficult. Instead move into that space immediately. Then test whether there is a skeleton just like before. If it is there, kill it, put the sword to your RIGHT then collect the BOULDER.","If there is no skeleton (in the else part) move down to the skeleton spawn and kill the skeleton. Then place yourself in the same way as before. That means collect the boulder and stand on top of the upper Enemy Spawn.","Both cases should end with a Knight on top of the upper Skeleton Spawn, facing EAST.\nBelow the \"else\" you can now order that Knight to move and drop its BOULDER.\nAfterwards a new Knight can collect the KEY and finish the Level!"],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall",{"item":"sword","content":"spawn"},"path",{"item":"boulder","id":1,"content":"enemy_spawn"},{"id":3,"content":"pressure_plate"},{"id":0,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall"],["wall","path","path","path","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","path",{"item":"key","content":"path"},{"id":2,"content":"enemy_spawn"},{"linkedIds":[0,3],"content":"gate"},"exit","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"]],"locToStars":[40,35]}
