Now in order make your knight face different direction at the start, you can enter a direction as parameter to its constructor: \"Knight lancelot = new Knight(EAST)\"\nYou can also test the other directions if you want to.","Now there's more things your knights can do than to walk straight and open doors.","They can also turn towards a different direction and use shovels in order to remove some dirt that is blocking their way.","To do this you must first \"collect()\" the shovel, then call the method \"turn(RIGHT)\" and finally \"useItem()\" to remove the blockage.\nOther options for turn are LEFT or AROUND which you may find in your Spellbook after you have completed the level!","Okay so how do you get around this key with a shovel in your hand? Well in order to do that we must first drop the shovel via \"dropItem()\".
