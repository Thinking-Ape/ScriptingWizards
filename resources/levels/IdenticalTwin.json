Then we can create another Knight just like before, except that he needs a different name.","To delete your old code either use your backspace key, delete key after clicking on the codefield you want to delete or press the \"Clear Code\" button!","Next to the \"Clear Code\" button is the \"Load Best Code\" button. You might have already wondered about its purpose.\nWhenever you replay a Level you have solved, clicking this button will load the best solution that you have found!","You could also try and see what happens if you reassign your Knight by writing the following:\nk = new Knight();\nAssuming you named your Knight k.","When you have done as described, we come to our next mechanic.

Step on it with your first knight and you will be able to walk through the gate with the other.","Better dont let the first one leave the pressure plate while the other one stands in the gate.
