The room is suddenly full of traps!\nThere is a window of exactly one turn, where you can safely walk over them. You will have to wait until the right moment to survive this!","You can keep your code from the last level. But you will have to make some adjustments. In order to find the right moment we will need the method \"targetIsDanger()\" which will be false unless there is a trap infront of you that will kill you when you walk on it.","So as long as this method is true the Knight should just wait:\nif(<knight name>.targetIsDanger()){\n\t<knight name>.wait();\n}","Another thing Knights can do, is to take a step backwards. This will be needed in this level, as you can only walk safely across behind the traps, if the Gate behind it is open. Luckily you have a Skeleton \"friend\" down there, opening them up from time to time.","So if you put a Conditional Statement asking if the Knight is looking at a GATE (targetsCell(GATE)) in the right space and telling your Knight to \"backOff()\", you will already have solved this puzzle!","If you're having trouble: The if-statement asking whether the knight's target is a Danger should be first. The old if-Statement asking whether the Knight can move should now be an \"else if-statement\" and after that you should put the \"else if\" containing the backOff!"],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","path","path","path","path","wall","path","trap","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall"],["wall",{"linkedIds":[3],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall","exit","path","wall","trap","wall","path","wall"],["wall","trap","wall","wall",{"item":"key","content":"path"},"wall",{"linkedIds":[1],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall","trap","wall"],["wall","path","path",{"linkedIds":[2],"content":"gate"},"trap","path","path","wall","path","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["wall","spawn","path","path","path","trap","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["empty","wall","enemy_spawn","path",{"id":1,"content":"pressure_plate"},{"id":2,"content":"pressure_plate"},{"id":3,"content":"pressure_plate"},"path","wall","empty"],["empty","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty"]],"locToStars":[28,24]}
