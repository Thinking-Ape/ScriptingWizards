The message that pops up will also contain this information: \"Linked Cell Ids: 1,0\".\nThis means that opening the GATE requires  PRESSURE_PLATEs with Id 1 and Id 0 to trigger.","By hovering your cursor over the PRESSURE_PLATEs you can see that one of them has Id 1 and the other has Id 0.","Remember that you can use Alt-Up and Alt-Down to move your current line of code. This will only work if the code is still correct after doing so!\nNote: Check your spellbook for all possible shortcuts!","When a Knight uses \"dropItem()\" while looking at another Knight facing in the opposite direction and not carrying an Item of their own, the first one passes their Item to the second one.","Using \"collect()\" while carrying an Item, will swap your carried Item with the one in front of you!\nTry to use only 2 Knights to solve this puzzle!\nOnly read the next message if you need help!","First remove the DIRT with the SHOVEL and pass it to the other Knight.
