You will learn a few tricks along the way that will allow you to solve the last puzzle with less code. But for now we will look at something different:","Another important part of Java are \"Loop Statements\"! Similar to \"Conditional Statements\" they also ask for a <condition>, but they don't differentiate between different courses of action and will run as long as the <condition> is met instead.","Our first type of \"Loop Statement\" is the while-Statement:\nwhile(<condition>) {\n\t<consequent>\n}\n","For our purposes write \"while (true) {\" and then press Enter. That means we want to repeat the following code infinitely! But don't worry it won't take an infinity to complete this level! We now want to add an if-Statement into our while-Statement.","It should check the following conditions:\n<knight name>.canMove()\n<knight name>.targetsCell(EXIT)\nCan you already solve this puzzle?\nNote: Replace <knight name> with the name of your Knight!","Inside your while-Statement you need this:\n\tif (<knight name>.canMove()){\n\t\t<knight name>.move();\n\t}","else if (<knight name>.targetsCell(EXIT)){\n\t<knight name>.useItem();\n}\nelse {\n\t<knight name>.turn(RIGHT);\n}"],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","spawn",{"item":"key","content":"path"},"path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","wall","path","path","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","wall","path","wall","exit","wall","path","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","path","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","wall","path","path","path","path","path","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["empty","empty","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"]],"locToStars":[13,9]}
