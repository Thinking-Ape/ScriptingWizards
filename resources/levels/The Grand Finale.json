The Grand Finale!\nThere is a lot going on!\nDon't despair. Try to figure out, which problem has to be solved first...","You can look at your Enemy's script, but you can also try it out to see what is happening.\nYou will need to declare multiple Armies in order to save a lot of time.\nMost of the time you can move 2 Knights at once. Try to find patterns!","You will have to hover your mouse a lot above the map to find the IDs of the cells.\nNote that it is possible to kill a Ghost. But not in its Ghostform...\nCan you already solve this puzzle?","If you're having trouble here is some further tips:\nFirst you can position the Knights at the SPAWNs with the IDs 8 and 9. You can move them both in the same way!","The Knight at SPAWN 8 should drop its BOULDER on the right side of the TRAP!\nBut before moving either Knight 8 or 9, Knight 8 should wait until the Ghost is before him and looking WEST.","Next you will want to tackle the problem of 6 and 7. 6 will have to be a Guardian who can push the Skeleton into the GATE and the KEY into the upmost row. Both Knights can move with a loop that contains a condition asking whether 6 targets an Entity or an item.","In these cases it should use its shield. After that the Knight that dropped the boulder should move left to the TRAP and getting possessed by the Ghost. It will then die due to the TRAP and BOULDER, triggering another Skeleton to spawn and open the upper GATE.","The Knight at the top should now hurry to enter through the GATE and run for his life as fast as possible. Which is not that fast, because the Knight at 10 will have to open the GATEs at the correct moment. Those 2 can be added into another Army.","At last the Knight with the shovel can move and use the shovel in another Army consisting of it and the Knight with the KEY. If you wait for the correct moment, everything should fall into place perfectly..."],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path","path",{"id":7,"content":"spawn"},"wall","wall"],["wall",{"linkedIds":[11],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall",{"linkedIds":[12],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":11,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall",{"id":15,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path",{"linkedIds":[13],"content":"gate"},"path",{"linkedIds":[14],"content":"gate"},"path",{"linkedIds":[17],"content":"gate"},"path",{"linkedIds":[18],"content":"gate"},"path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","trap","wall"],["wall","path","wall",{"id":3,"content":"enemy_spawn"},{"id":12,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall","wall","wall","wall","path","path","path","wall","path","wall"],["wall",{"item":"key","id":0,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","path","path","path","wall","path","wall","trap","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall",{"id":1,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path","path","trap","path","path",{"id":2,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"wall","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall",{"item":"boulder","id":8,"content":"spawn"},"wall","trap","wall"],["wall","path","wall",{"id":9,"content":"spawn"},"wall","wall",{"id":10,"content":"spawn"},{"id":13,"content":"pressure_plate"},{"id":14,"content":"pressure_plate"},{"id":17,"content":"pressure_plate"},{"id":18,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall","wall",{"linkedIds":[16],"content":"path"},"wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall",{"item":"shovel","content":"path"},"wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall",{"linkedIds":[16],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","dirt","path","dirt","path","dirt",{"id":16,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall","exit","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","path","path","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty","empty"],["wall",{"id":6,"content":"spawn"},"wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty"],["wall","wall","wall","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty","empty"]],"locToStars":[64,59]}
