First like the Skeletons you can specify a SPAWN, using its ID. Hover your mouse above the SPAWNs to find it. Secondly you can control more than just one Knight at a time!","To do that you will need to spawn your Knights first and then create a new Army, including them. Look at what your Enemy did in their script. Can you already solve the puzzle?","If you're having trouble here is some further tips:\nFirst create 3 Knights (k1,k2 and k3) at 3 different Spawns. Then add them to an Army like this:\nArmy knights = new Army(k1,k2,k3);","To solve this puzzle, there are numerous possibilities. Here is a possible solution:\nStart with a for statement, that loops 3 times (thats the amount of enemies).  Now create a while loop that makes the Knights wait until the Knight on the right sees a Skeleton:","while(!(k3.targetsEntity())) {\n\tknights.wait();\n}\nAnd after that make all of them wait once and move twice.\nTry this out and see what happens.","There should occur a problem as the Skeleton must look in the right DIRECTION for this to work. To check that we want to create a new boolean above the while loop:\nboolean looksEast = false;","Now we change the while loop:\nwhile(!(k.targetsEntity()&&looksEast)){\nknights.wait();\nlooksEast = k3.targetIsLooking(EAST);\n}\nThis will always update the boolean and ...","check whether the Skeleton is not only in front of the 3rd Knight but also looks EAST.\nNote that you cannot just write:\nboolean looksEast = k3.targetIsLooking(EAST);\nbecause this will not update its value inside of the loop!","Lastly you can take control of the individual Knights again to finish the Level!\nLook at the PRESSURE_PLATEs IDs to find out what they do..."],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty"],["wall","pressure_plate","wall","exit","wall",{"id":8,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall","empty"],["wall",{"id":7,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall",{"item":"key","content":"path"},"wall","pressure_plate","wall","empty"],["wall",{"id":9,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall",{"linkedIds":[7,8],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall","pressure_plate","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":1,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path",{"linkedIds":[9],"flags":["inverted"],"content":"gate"},"path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":2,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":3,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":4,"content":"spawn"},"wall",{"id":5,"content":"spawn"},"wall",{"id":6,"content":"spawn"},"wall","empty"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty"]],"locToStars":[23,21]}
