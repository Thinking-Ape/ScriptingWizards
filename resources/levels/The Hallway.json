First like the Skeletons you can specify a SPAWN, using its ID. Hover your mouse above the SPAWNs to find it. Secondly you can control more than just one Knight at a time!","To do that you will need to spawn your Knights first and then create a new Army, including them. Look at what your Enemy did in their script. Can you already solve the puzzle?","If you're having trouble here is some further tips:\nFirst create 3 Knights (k1,k2 and k3) at 3 different Spawns. Then add them to an Army like this:\nArmy knights = new Army(k1,k2,k3);","To solve this puzzle, there are numerous possibilities. Here is a possible solution:\nStart with a for statement, that loops 3 times (thats the amount of enemies).  Now create a while loop that makes the Knights wait until the Knight on the right sees a Skeleton:","while(!(k3.targetsEntity())) {\n\tknights.wait();\n}\nAnd after that make all of them wait, move twice and then wait again.","Lastly you can take control of the individual Knights again to finish the Level!"],"map":[["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty"],["wall","pressure_plate","wall","exit","wall",{"id":8,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall","empty"],["wall",{"id":7,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall",{"item":"key","content":"path"},"wall","pressure_plate","wall","empty"],["wall",{"id":9,"content":"pressure_plate"},"wall",{"linkedIds":[7,8],"flags":["turned"],"content":"gate"},"wall","pressure_plate","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":1,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path",{"linkedIds":[9],"flags":["inverted"],"content":"gate"},"path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":2,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":3,"content":"enemy_spawn"},"path","path","path","path","path","wall"],["wall","path","wall","path","wall","path","wall","wall"],["wall",{"id":4,"content":"spawn"},"wall",{"id":5,"content":"spawn"},"wall",{"id":6,"content":"spawn"},"wall","empty"],["wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","wall","empty"]],"locToStars":[24,20]}
