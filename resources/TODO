OPTIONAL:
-push() method? (Rather not)
-language settings
-duplicate code in new lvl, open lvl, edit lvl?
-how to display item currently carried?
-delete() method? (rather not)
-make traps trigger via pressure plates also?
-enemies not skeletons but enemy knights (no)? -> need to attack instead of walking into you? (maybe no sword necessary? yes or no?)
-instead of a key -> collect all treasures?? -> exits dont need to be opened but you lose the round if you dont collect all treasure?
-isAlive() method
-CodeAreaController -> rework? (branch!)

IMPORTANT:
-----------------------------------
-build a prototype -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53453212/how-to-deploy-a-javafx-11-desktop-application-with-a-jre
-variable names restrict possible names??
-add all VariableTypes enumerated in the enum
-end goal always to unlock the exit? <- the wizard wants to escape, not the knights! => no open tag!

-dropItem() method (Rather yes)
-define own methods?? (Big!!)
-wizard speech bubbles as tutorial gui?
-beacon -> every other knight/skeleton mimicks this one! (ambitious!)
-DIRECTION: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST
-TURN_DIRECTION: LEFT, RIGHT, AROUND
-allow booleans with other value than true or false!
-tutorial GUI -> make user codearea smaller when tutorial is active??
-if problems with JSONParser -> remove abstract
-data: tutorial progress
-Status whether level is saved or if changes will be lost
-tutorialtext in level descriptions -> make editable! (tutorial textarea in texteditor but editable)
-create a spellbook for Skeletons (steal() instead of collect?? attack?)
-change RequiredLevellist from String to Levels to avoid confusion with what needs to be saved
OR
-reimplement saving mechanism? New class UnsavedData or similarly named
-LevelOverviewPane: replace level descriptions with other information like max knights, level_size and requirements for certain star ratings!
-TODO: tutorialDeletion in view as a case!!
---------------------------------------------

DONE:

27.09.
Make spellbook open on request and dont always show it!
find place for show spellbook button, tutorial textarea + forward and backwards buttons -> stackpane??
show tutorial levels exclusively in tutorial (??? maybe its okay to show in play scene?)
display Levelname in Playmode!
changing level name in editor -> extra button because name of file should be changed and the entry in data and requiredlevel also!!

26.09.
TODO:[might still be an issue]adjust to codeAreacontroller no longer "null"! Instead ask for isEmpty() [do controller and model search for null tests!]
make codefield scrollable! no 2 blocks!!
atm you cannot edit the intelligent codefield via clicks without have used arrow keys or enter etc. beforehand!

23.09.
Levelname in VBOX over level!
Spellbook field right of the map
Knight <variable name> = new Knight(<Direction>); <- tooltips
github

21.09.
see controller: Line 110 TODO???

19.09:
indexing
reload lvl btn? (why again?)
save player code upon finishing a level? -> store in data!
reset score for a level in editor
visualize knights left
update levellist of "Play" everytime? (because deleting in editor does not delete in "Play"!)
