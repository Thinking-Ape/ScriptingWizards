OPTIONAL:
-push() method? (Rather not)
-language settings
-duplicate code in new lvl, open lvl, edit lvl?
-how to display item currently carried?
-delete() method? (rather not)
-make traps trigger via pressure plates also?
-enemies not skeletons but enemy knights (no)? -> need to attack instead of walking into you? (maybe no sword necessary? yes or no?)
-instead of a key -> collect all treasures?? -> exits dont need to be opened but you lose the round if you dont collect all treasure?
-isAlive() method
-CodeAreaController -> rework? (branch!)
-Key looks kinda bad...
-create a spellbook for Skeletons (steal() instead of collect?? attack?)

IMPORTANT:
-----------------------------------
-build a prototype -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53453212/how-to-deploy-a-javafx-11-desktop-application-with-a-jre
-variable names restrict possible names??
-add all VariableTypes enumerated in the enum
-end goal always to unlock the exit? <- the wizard wants to escape, not the knights! => no open tag!

-change RequiredLevellist from String to Levels to avoid confusion with what needs to be saved
    OR
    -reimplement saving mechanism? New class UnsavedData or similarly named
    OR
    -message upon saving: the following levels will be saved too, due to changes they are connected to
-LevelOverviewPane: replace level descriptions with other information like max knights, level_size and requirements for certain star ratings!
-Exit needs more gold/shininess!
-Fullscreen mode
-dropItem() method (Rather yes)
-define own methods?? (Big!!)
-wizard speech bubbles as tutorial gui?
-beacon -> every other knight/skeleton mimicks this one! (ambitious!)
-DIRECTION: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST
-TURN_DIRECTION: LEFT, RIGHT, AROUND
-tutorial GUI -> make user codearea smaller when tutorial is active??
-data: tutorial progress
-Status whether level is saved or if changes will be lost
-Why is every assignment parsed twice?? (codeparser -> parseassignment sout -> twice in commandline)
---------------------------------------------

DONE:

1.10.
allow booleans with other value than true or false!
tutorialDeletion in view as a case!!
tutorialtext in level descriptions -> make editable! (tutorial textarea in texteditor but editable)
Back btn and others should be inactive when game is running!

27.09.
Make spellbook open on request and dont always show it!
find place for show spellbook button, tutorial textarea + forward and backwards buttons -> stackpane??
show tutorial levels exclusively in tutorial (??? maybe its okay to show in play scene?)
display Levelname in Playmode!
changing level name in editor -> extra button because name of file should be changed and the entry in data and requiredlevel also!!

26.09.
TODO:[might still be an issue]adjust to codeAreacontroller no longer "null"! Instead ask for isEmpty() [do controller and model search for null tests!]
make codefield scrollable! no 2 blocks!!
atm you cannot edit the intelligent codefield via clicks without have used arrow keys or enter etc. beforehand!

23.09.
Levelname in VBOX over level!
Spellbook field right of the map
Knight <variable name> = new Knight(<Direction>); <- tooltips
github

21.09.
see controller: Line 110 TODO???

19.09:
indexing
reload lvl btn? (why again?)
save player code upon finishing a level? -> store in data!
reset score for a level in editor
visualize knights left
update levellist of "Play" everytime? (because deleting in editor does not delete in "Play"!)
