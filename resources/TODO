OPTIONAL:
-boulder -> barrel that can roll?
-push() method? (Rather not)
-delete() method? (rather not)
-make traps trigger via pressure plates also?
-create a spellbook for Skeletons (steal() instead of collect?? attack?)
-tutorial GUI -> make user codearea smaller when tutorial is active??
(-add getters for entities?)
(-from executeIf(a.canMove(),...,...) -> executeIf(canMove())??? because it is not in line with if(a.canMove())?? (BUT: a.canMove() == k1.canMove()) is valid in my opinion?!)
-execute one line at a time
-cheap graphics option?
-alle escape sequenzen implementieren
-be able to reset various aspects of data?
-Required Levels entfernen?
-replace the number argument with a color and give the spawns different colors?? (CFlag.RED,CFlag.VIOLET)
-Level_1_... Levelname conventions
- Wenn möglich, die Zeilen etwas größer machen. Größere Fontsize für Code.
- Buttons für das Entfernen und Hinzufügen von Zeilen an bestimmten Stellen wären super. ZB. ein rotes Kreuz bei allen Zeilen, die man gerade löschen kann.
- Allgemein mehr Features für den Editor wie zB. Markieren oder Drag & Drop von Code-Zeilen wären sehr hilfreich.
- add difficulty attribute
- show difficulty and best result yet in selection mode
- add all VariableTypes enumerated in the enum
- evil wizard explains level editor?
- leveleditor open with a dialog whether to open a level or create a new one
- merge new variabletype functionality with regexes used elsewhere (Direction enum not needed anymore?)
-----------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
-----------------------------------
- define own methods?? <- didnt work out
- language settings
- eliminate duplicate code in new lvl, open lvl, edit lvl?
- code refactoring: more methods less nesting
- newturns > turns but newlines < lines -> better? (not justifiable to give 2.5!)
- index bugged out once -> might have to do with creating a new level and not saving it (check case insensitivity of level names)
- Refactorings: no Direction enum, Use the allowedRegexes (instead of .matches(LEFT|RIGHT|...), evaluation of statements, Interface Condition questionable
- create a clean event handling implementation!
- CodeAreaController Listens to CodeArea and sets the handlers everytime it changes
 - rethink required levels
 - cannot put empty or content when there wasnt a wall before...
 - check arguments of skeleton constructor whether they are viable...
 - allow XOR (^)?
 - make controlElements ignore keyboard input?
 - Clean up CodeParser
 - readme
 - png to jpg? for smaller images?
 - cut empty from map?
 - find another way to load images?
 - reimplement Conditions with regex
 - only test if DEBUG? - dont build into game?
 - Kurse anstelle von Tutorial? -> 10. Klasse vs. 7. Klasse
 - Möglichkeit, kurse zu erstellen!
 - getCell()
 - Ingame upon hovering over a cell -> show information about this cell as a tooltip

 - The Revenant 36,38
---------------------------------------------


DONE:
-> moving to changelog.txt
20.02.
mark line of executed Code!
CodeAreas are now scrollable per Mousewheel
Improved scrolling in general
Made Game pauseable!
Made Game speed changeable dynamically!
For more see changelog.txt
19.02.
tutorial text area in editor module now can only have as much text as can be displayed
created a README
removed image from repository as there is now a download link
18.02.
reworked SpeedSlider and Knob
made Spellbook movable
made Dialogs prettier
added Star Rating images
Empty Lines no longer count as loc
Made a few things prettier
Buttons now have effects
17.02.
hopefully fixed double escaping not working (\t\t -> "  \t")
also fixed highlights not in the right place
16.02.

 put tutorial section next to show spell book?!
 hide tutorial section if you want to!
actually a lot of progress but too lazy... -> look at commit-message
15.02.
can edit enemy code during play/tutorial
int i; says -> empty condition!!!
rearranged tutorial Wizard graphic
14.02.
drew Tutorial Wizard and various Buttons
added Brick-Background
added Border to ActualMapGPane

23.10.
adapt visuals to be relative instead of absolute!
skell.canMove() shouldnt be an allowed statement!
create zip!!
make all visible things relative

22.10.
fixed json parser to be able to handle escape symbols

16.10.
menu after winning playmode -> back, replay or next level
images for destroyed items etc.!
could also recolor the spawn and give knights differen colors... (too much work!!) -> maybe filter in java itself?
disabling execute btn when isError wasnt updated
!b -> a variable must not be named... fix this, also fix the code of the last stand level!

15.10.
add and update the tutorial edit section!
Strg UP or DOWN can move codefields up or DOWN, if it is allowed

14.10.
fill spellbook slowly and also add all variables!
readme with info (e.g. shift clicking in editor etc.)
empty level causes nullpointer if there is no spawn!
three brothers level

13.10.
can add same entity twice to army!
unlock statementtypes
fixed a bug where Command would not test executeIf for correctness

12.10.
instead of ItemType null -> ItemType.NONE
buggy codearea when holding down vs having to click twice to be able to execute -> Platform.runLater in CodeArea is issue and solution
knight.getItemType() + knight.getDirection() + etc.
maybe datatype Command? executeIf(<boolean>,<Command>,<Command>) or executeIf(<boolean>,<Command>,<Command>) and executeIf is also a Command?
scrolling is bad atm
adapt conditions to army? what is army allowed and what is it not?
items are still shown as clickable even if they shouldnt <- badly implemented!
attacking can destroy items? (but only if they are not boulders!
adding Scrollbar fucks up the layout
create a scrollbar class that has exactly 2 instances and stores 2 integers

11.10.
Army army and Method army.executeIf(<Action>,<Condition>)
multicell editing
executeIf Command for Knights,Skeletons as well as for armies -> 2 or 3 parameters + maybe doesnt count as 1 loc but as 3 or 5?

10.10.
skeleton cannot useItem()!
change action animation every second frame
keythief enemy lives after having been killed!!!
Gate is now only passable from the right direction!

9.10.
draw entities last? (multi cell images)
attack animations
adapt skeleton code to attack
variable names restrict possible names??
Knight give items
Knight death "animation"
remove glowing background from sword etc
how to display item currently carried?
skeleton.attack() (no skeleton.move()!)
exit open -> shiny exit!
Exit rework
Knight remove so much glow

6.10. - 8.10.
Exit needs more gold/shininess!
let gate have a flag that is purely visual? -> horizontal/vertical
codearea controller listens to view
gate make path as dark as other paths!
instead of removing the spawn redraw it without the glow

5.10.
tutorial opening screen if tutprogress == -1
endless loop -> popup and reset!
remove spawn when there are no knight tokens left

4.10.
end goal always to unlock the exit? <- the wizard wants to escape, not the knights! => no open tag!
knight icons left of map
button to load best code yet (with which you completed a specific level)
LevelOverviewPane: replace level descriptions with other information like max knights, level_size and requirements for certain star ratings!
Fullscreen mode
let randInt take variables!
data: tutorial progress
variable assignment causes nullpointer! + what if variables get variables as value (no recursion yet?)
CodeParser TestForCorrectValueType!

2.10.
variables must not be named LEFT, RIGHT, AROUND, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, KEY
DIRECTION: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST
Booleans and Expressions -> find better solution! (merge the 2 so they work together!)
dropItem() method

1.10.
allow booleans with other value than true or false!
tutorialDeletion in view as a case!!
tutorialtext in level descriptions -> make editable! (tutorial textarea in texteditor but editable)
Back btn and others should be inactive when game is running!

27.09.
Make spellbook open on request and dont always show it!
find place for show spellbook button, tutorial textarea + forward and backwards buttons -> stackpane??
show tutorial levels exclusively in tutorial (??? maybe its okay to show in play scene?)
display Levelname in Playmode!
changing level name in editor -> extra button because name of file should be changed and the entry in data and requiredlevel also!!

26.09.
adjust to codeAreacontroller no longer "null"! Instead ask for isEmpty() [do controller and model search for null tests!]
make codefield scrollable! no 2 blocks!!
atm you cannot edit the intelligent codefield via clicks without have used arrow keys or enter etc. beforehand!

23.09.
Levelname in VBOX over level!
Spellbook field right of the map
Knight <variable name> = new Knight(<Direction>); <- tooltips
github

21.09.
see controller: Line 110

19.09:
indexing
reload lvl btn? (why again?)
save player code upon finishing a level? -> store in data!
reset score for a level in editor
visualize knights left
update levellist of "Play" everytime? (because deleting in editor does not delete in "Play"!)
