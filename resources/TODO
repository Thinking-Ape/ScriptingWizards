OPTIONAL:
-boulder -> barrel that can roll?
-push() method? (Rather not)
-delete() method? (rather not)
-make traps trigger via pressure plates also?
-create a spellbook for Skeletons (steal() instead of collect?? attack?)
-tutorial GUI -> make user codearea smaller when tutorial is active??
(-add getters for entities?)
(-from executeIf(a.canMove(),...,...) -> executeIf(canMove())??? because it is not in line with if(a.canMove())?? (BUT: a.canMove() == k1.canMove()) is valid in my opinion?!)
-execute one line at a time
-cheap graphics option?
-alle escape sequenzen implementieren
-be able to reset various aspects of data?
-Required Levels entfernen?
-replace the number argument with a color and give the spawns different colors?? (CFlag.RED,CFlag.VIOLET)
-Level_1_... Levelname conventions
- Wenn möglich, die Zeilen etwas größer machen. Größere Fontsize für Code.
- Buttons für das Entfernen und Hinzufügen von Zeilen an bestimmten Stellen wären super. ZB. ein rotes Kreuz bei allen Zeilen, die man gerade löschen kann.
- Allgemein mehr Features für den Editor wie zB. Markieren oder Drag & Drop von Code-Zeilen wären sehr hilfreich.
- add difficulty attribute
- show difficulty and best result yet in selection mode
- add all VariableTypes enumerated in the enum
- evil wizard explains level editor?
- leveleditor open with a dialog whether to open a level or create a new one
- merge new variabletype functionality with regexes used elsewhere (Direction enum not needed anymore?)
- remove currentcourse <- widerspriucht evt currentlevel
- 3 Stars in all challenges might be near impossible... maybe only 2 Stars?
- make cell_Ids automatic?
- challenges always available?
- Knight assignment -> multiple knights used? because they are different objects? -> no replaced!
- required Ids -> boolean?!
- resetlevelscore immediately updated?
- zip mit freigeschaltetem Level-Editor für die SuS?
- cannotMove?
- data is zugemüllt nach import mit alten daten... sollte aufgeräumt werden
-----------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
-----------------------------------
- define own methods?? <- didnt work out
- language settings
- eliminate duplicate code in new lvl, open lvl, edit lvl?
- code refactoring: more methods less nesting
- newturns > turns but newlines < lines -> better? (not justifiable to give 2.5!)
- index bugged out once -> might have to do with creating a new level and not saving it (check case insensitivity of level names)
- Refactorings: no Direction enum, Use the allowedRegexes (instead of .matches(LEFT|RIGHT|...), evaluation of statements, Interface Condition questionable
- create a clean event handling implementation!
- CodeAreaController Listens to CodeArea and sets the handlers everytime it changes
 - rethink required levels
 - cannot put empty or content when there wasnt a wall before...
 - check arguments of skeleton constructor whether they are viable...
 - allow XOR (^)?
 - make controlElements ignore keyboard input?
 - Clean up CodeParser
 - readme
 - png to jpg? for smaller images?
 - cut empty from map?
 - find another way to load images?
 - reimplement Conditions with regex
 - only test if DEBUG? - dont build into game?
 - Kurse anstelle von Tutorial? -> 10. Klasse vs. 7. Klasse
 - Möglichkeit, kurse zu erstellen!
 - getCell()
 - How to apply patch for students?
 - Verteile cell ids automactisch (xxyy? 0000 bis 1515 oder 0 bis 225)
 - mehrere Player Spawns?

16.02.

 put tutorial section next to show spell book?!
 hide tutorial section if you want to!
actually a lot of progress but too lazy... -> look at commit-message
15.02.

int i; says -> empty condition!!!
rearranged tutorial Wizard graphic
14.02.
drew Tutorial Wizard and various Buttons
added Brick-Background
added Border to ActualMapGPane

23.10.
adapt visuals to be relative instead of absolute!
skell.canMove() shouldnt be an allowed statement!
create zip!!
make all visible things relative

22.10.
fixed json parser to be able to handle escape symbols

16.10.
menu after winning playmode -> back, replay or next level
images for destroyed items etc.!
could also recolor the spawn and give knights differen colors... (too much work!!) -> maybe filter in java itself?
disabling execute btn when isError wasnt updated
!b -> a variable must not be named... fix this, also fix the code of the last stand level!

15.10.
add and update the tutorial edit section!
Strg UP or DOWN can move codefields up or DOWN, if it is allowed

empty level causes nullpointer if there is no spawn!
three brothers level

13.10.
can add same entity twice to army!
unlock statementtypes
fixed a bug where Command would not test executeIf for correctness

12.10.
instead of ItemType null -> ItemType.NONE
buggy codearea when holding down vs having to click twice to be able to execute -> Platform.runLater in CodeArea is issue and solution
knight.getItemType() + knight.getDirection() + etc.
maybe datatype Command? executeIf(<boolean>,<Command>,<Command>) or executeIf(<boolean>,<Command>,<Command>) and executeIf is also a Command?
scrolling is bad atm
adapt conditions to army? what is army allowed and what is it not?
items are still shown as clickable even if they shouldnt <- badly implemented!
attacking can destroy items? (but only if they are not boulders!
adding Scrollbar fucks up the layout
create a scrollbar class that has exactly 2 instances and stores 2 integers

tutorial opening screen if tutprogress == -1
endless loop -> popup and reset!
remove spawn when there are no knight tokens left

4.10.
